## About
This is a web app project that allows users to search for ingredients to view their description <br>
The app will use data from [The Meal API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

## MVP
- A list of ingredients
- A input section to search for ingredient description
- A custom `clear` text function to clear displayed description
- When a user enters an ingredient that is not in the API, a prompt shows up
- The input section must be filled, else it will prompt the user to add input

## User story
- As a user, I can be able to search ingredients to view their description
- As a user, I can be able to clear the displayed description by typing `clear` in the input section

## Metrics of success
1. Present files- index.html, styles.css, index.js
2. Create html form
3. Use fetch() to communicate with the server [The Meal API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
4. Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM allowing better User Expreience
5. Use JavaScript to create events listeners for search button
6. Use CSS to style the landing page for a better User Interface
